                  DiscoBoard Release Notes: Version 1.7.1
                  ---------------------------------------
April 24, 2003

More patches and updates. Special thanks must go to carlmmii for his
one-man crusade to find bugs / exploits / holes and report them for
this release. With his help, DiscoBoard is slowly becoming a lot more
robust.
