---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCOBOARD ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.7.1
------
 - New markup code:
    - /me is replaced with IRC-style "* (name of poster)"...
    - [icon=URL] makes a pretty display intended for a board icon 
      (80x80) but really could be used for any 80x80px image
 - Icon selection is fixed so you can see the icons again (whoops)
 - IP checker now works again out-of-the-box
 - PMs are now sorted recent-oldest
 - Easier to add lots of icons to the same group
 - Paginated icon management
 - Removed markup exploits in various locations that could break the
   system's HTML layout
 - System default posts- and threads-per-page settings are now written
   to the profile of a new user
 - Number of posts "today" on the front page should now be indicative of 
   the number of posts made since 00:00 in the user's timezone
 - Removed anyone-can-lock-any-thread security hole
 - Fixed decrementing of the reply count in a thread when a message is
   deleted from it
 - Titles can now have markup codes used in them
 - IGN faces are now carlmmii's replacements
 
v1.7
----
 - New markup code:
    - [strike][/strike] does strikethrough
    - [spaces][/spaces] tells the browser to output all whitespace
    - [bq][/bq] is shorthand for [blockquote]
 - Admin: New tool allows source code inspection of any file
 - Admin: New tool allows you to set a title for any Member
 - Icons: The icon system now runs from the database instead of the
   filesystem. This means no more headaches with write access to the
   gfx/icons directory! Run setup-icons.php until you can't run it
   anymore and your icon migration is complete.
 - URL-grabber now allows ~ character (and don't I feel silly)
 - URL-grabber now allows & character (somehow...)
 - Only shows users active in the last 10 minutes in Currently Online
 - View-thread link shown after making a new post now goes to the page
   your post is on (well, the last page ... that should be the one your
   post is on unless your board is very busy!)
 - You can use AccessProtocol to tell DiscoBoards it's running in https
 - Banned users can no longer post, even when they've logged in prior
   to being banned
 - Thread deletion now asks for confirmation via Javascript
 - Database query optimisation - now fetches username formatting as
   part of bulk listing operations rather than querying the database
   for (nearly) every username displayed
 - Commenced splitting of function files, to optimise page load times
   by not loading unneccessary functions
 - Users can no longer lock a thread they didn't start by posting and
   editing their post
 - Now properly checks a user's threshold setting prior to posting
 - Users now get stars when they reach a level, rather than when they
   exceed it


v1.6.2
------
 - Rudimentary database setup script - run it, copy the SQL from the 
   files in support/ (database-tables.sql, database-data.sql) and then 
   DELETE this file. No need for already-running systems to do anything, 
   just delete the file.
 - It's now possible to ban someone from the system by their IP address
   rather than banning their account. This can be done either with a
   specific user in mind (block all access from IP X from user Y), or
   just a blanket block on all access from an IP.
 - Private messages now strip slashes a little more intelligently on
   sending and replying
 - unsupported [markup] [codes] are now ignored
 - Now sends no-cache headers for each page if you're logged in ('cos
   iPrimus' proxy server sucks)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.6.1
------
 - Session logout bug has been fixed... sorry :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.6
----

 - Added support for customised Terms Of Service
 - Admin tools have been rebuilt to present themselves in a frameset 
   so they're always available to admins who wish to have them that way
 - Private Messages now output their Message ID in the controls area, so
   that a user can alert administrator about a message's contents by 
   just giving the message ID
 - Admins can now make notes about a user (notes are available to all
   administrators)
 - Added admin tool to view a single message
 - DiscoBoard can now address its database tables with a prefix to them,
   so that it can coexist happily with other applications in the same
   database and maintain unique table names.
 - Users without an icon set now don't see anything
 - Moderator functions don't output debugging information
 - Markup problems with links and images FINALLY fixed (fingers crossed)
 - Following the KISS principle, board and thread viewing functionality 
   has been moved out of index.php, to board.php and thread.php and 
   linkage has been adjusted sitewide.
   >>> If you're using settings.X.php or indeed anything else to add 
       custom deep links to existing boards or threads to any part of 
       your site or board configuration, you will need to change those 
       links by going to the page manually and re-copying the URL. 
       Sorry.
 - Admin tools now output system-standard tables instead of plain ones
 - Groups / Favourite Board display page now offers an option to Open or
   Close All groups, if appropriate (decided by system default for the
   same thing)
 - Admins can now move boards from group to group
 - Users can now select No Icon if they already have one
 - Icon deletion should be fixed now (again)
 - Fixed a bug in Display Options that would set the user's threads/page
   selector by default to their posts/page setting
 - Removing a user from the Watched User List was broken in v1.52, now
   fixed so you can remove users you don't like again :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.52
-----
 - Moderators can now lock/unlock a thread when editing a post in that 
   thread
 - Users can now lock/unlock their own threads within the edit time 
   limit
 - User access classes can now have a default format specified - this 
   format will be copied into a user's settings when they're moved from 
   one class to another
 - URL-grabber got a bit greedy and took anything with "..." to be a 
   URL. This version now has a workaround in place.
 - Moved edit-existing-post functionality into a separate page 
   (postedit.php)
 - Preview now works properly (would previously break edit-prev-edit 
   chain)
 - IP Search didn't include its' form element properly, and broke
 - Site Administrators can now decide whether they want to display the 
   ID of the last poster to a thread or not
 - IP Searching now returns the hostname that an IP resolves to

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.51
-----
 - Localised timezone settings for members (configure: Options-Display)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.5
----
 - Can now completely disable logins
 - Formatting of user's post count is 1,000 not 1000 in profiles
 - Slghtly more informative timezone settings
 - CSS construction of name borders now uses MSIE-Idiot-Proof(tm) 
   border attribute if all borders are on instead of defining all 
   four borders individually.
 - Now sends the user an email when their password is changed
 - Now orders WUL entries alphabetically
 - Now logs user's current IP address at registration
 - Now formats numbers (post counts mainly) properly as x,xxx.
 - No longer counts editing a post in threshold calculations

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.41
-----
 - Localised timezone settings for members (via Display in Options)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.4
----
 - Watched User List (WUL) - users can now watch other users
 - Watch a Thread - users can watch their favourite threads
 - Profile display enhancements:
    - Online status indicators for instant message mediums
    - Watched User List
    - Watching User List
    - Class name shown after username for non-hidden classes
 - Users with custom username formats can now specifically select bold
 - Link to thread view on Post Reply page
 - Private message Sent Messages pagination is now correct - it used to 
   count ALL messages you've sent rather than just private (which 
   explains why most people's message lists ended on page 2).
 - Watch Thread no longer 404's since watched threads are now 
   implemented

(Changes prior to v1.4 have been removed)
