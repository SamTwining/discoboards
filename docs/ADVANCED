DISCOBOARD ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[!] Before you go any further, you should understand that this document
    assumes at least a basic understanding of PHP programming: syntax,
    concepts and functions are discussed. A working knowledge of HTML
    and CSS is also handy if you're going to configure the look and feel 
    of this system.
 
 >>> If you still want to proceed, make sure you keep backups of known
     good, working Themes and Stylesheets before you commit any changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, you've set up your DiscoBoard system. Now you'll want to make it 
"your own" by perhaps changing the colours, or adding some graphical 
frills to the page.

This document talks briefly about advanced configuration issues and
exposes the soft and fleshy belly of DiscoBoard to those who need to
know how it runs. It covers:

 - Introduction to Themes
 - System Design Principles
 - The DiscoBoard StyleSheet
 
This should be enough to cover the basics, but if lots of people have 
difficulty in doing advanced configurations of DiscoBoard systems, I'll
have to write some additional documentation. Of course, remember that 
the person who knows the system best is the one who wrote it. Don't be
afraid to pop up on ICQ or AIM and ask me to configure something for
you. :)

The first thing to understand is that you shouldn't need to change ANY
files except for the Big Three:

 - settings.X.php
 - theme.blah.php
 - stylesheet.blah.php

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction to Themes
----------------------
This document explains how DiscoBoard's Theme System works. A Theme is a
combination of Theme and Stylesheet files to which DiscoBoard will pass
its page contents and they'll be enclosed accordingly. 

A Theme file has two main content blocks, $pagetop and $pageend, which 
are sent out to the browser before and after the main DiscoBoard system 
output respectively:

+-------------------------+
| Page Top                |
+-------------------------+
| Main DiscoBoard System  |
| Output Area             |
+-------------------------+
| Page End                |
+-------------------------+

With some creative table designs, you could enclose your DiscoBoard in
a more complicated design:

+-------------------------+
| Page Top                |
+ +---------------------+-+
| | Main System         | |
| | Output Area         | |
+-+---------------------+ +
| Page End                |
+-------------------------+

You may be interested to know that the default "disco" theme is a very 
simple version of this kind of design.

If you wanted to place a banner advertisement at the top of each page on
your DiscoBoard system, you'd need to open up your Theme File (the Theme 
you're using is defined in your Settings file) and insert the HTML code
for the banner into $pagetop in the appropriate place. Similarly, if you
wanted *random* banner ads, you'd need to write the logic to generate 
the banner ads at the top of the Theme file, and use it in the right 
point in $pagestart or $pagestop.

 >>> A Theme doesn't have to output anything. Let's say you decide to
     move your DiscoBoard system to a different URL. In order to *not*
     break any bookmarks users may have on their own systems, you can
     use a Theme which redirects users to the new URL. An example of 
     such a Theme (theme.redirect.php) is included which doesn't do
     anything except a Header() to redirect the browser and then it
     just Exit()'s altogether.

Because the Theme file is a PHP script, you need to be sure you don't
break the PHP syntax when you're editing it. If you do, you'll know 
you've done it soon enough - the board's look and feel will disappear
and be replaced by an error message.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
System Design Principles
------------------------
(or, "Why Things Are The Way They Are")
DiscoBoard is a modular system in that each main file in the system 
carries out one singular purpose. The web-accessible files are kept in 
one directory, on a flat level (there's not much point putting them 
into a directory structure, since the system's contents are all drawn 
from a database).

The most important concepts and files are explained here, so that you 
can modify the system as needed:

 - Elements (kept in the elements/ directory)
   These files are kept in the elements/ directory, and are called 
   upon by the system as needed via include(). Each file is a simple
   PHP script which defines a form or some variable. If you're using
   an element file, you'll already know what variable it defines.
   DiscoBoard's elements contains things like the login form, new 
   post form, a frameset and profile edit/show tables.
 
 - Templates (kept in the templates/ directory)
   These are templates for outbound emails. When a DiscoBoard function
   needs to send an email, it will get the template data with file(),
   and send it with sendSystemEmail() which adds the proper headers and
   signature to the outbound email. 
 
 - Important System Files
   There are a number of files which serve an important purpose in the
   DiscoBoard system. These are files you shouldn't need to touch, or
   edit. Here's a brief roundup:
   
    - common.php
      Decides what the name of the settings file should be, include()'s
      it, establishes the connection to MySQL, sets up configuration
      defaults, include()'s function files and performs session 
      validation.
    
    - functions.*.php
      Support functions that actually perform most of the hard work
      behind the scenes to make DiscoBoard work. These are broken up
      into board-, html-, session-related and generic functions.
    
    - javascript.php
      Support JavaScript functions, as needed. There's only on at the
      moment, which is used to make moderators confirm a delete post
      command. This file should be referred to by a Theme.
    
    - layout.php
      Decides what options to display to the user in the menu row, 
      forms the navigational heirarchy, and populates pagination and 
      other related informational rows on the system layout. Finally,
      it include()'s the Theme file and echo's its output.
      
    - puke.php
      Not strictly part of DiscoBoard at all - this script just runs
      phpInfo() for debugging purposes
      
    - setup.php
      This script's sole purpose is to take a username and upgrade it
      to Super User status. Once this is done, you should either delete
      it or chmod it to 000.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DiscoBoard StyleSheet
-------------------------
This section describes the CSS styles used in a DiscoBoard stylesheet. 
In future DiscoBoard releases, further styles may be added. These will
be advised in the upgrade notification.

The CSS styles applied to DiscoBoard systems are:

A 

  Standard look and decoration for links

A:hover

  Standard look and decoration for links when the mouse is over them

BODY, TD

  Default text for use on a page and in a table cell (TD) - should be
  the same for simplicity

.PlainText

  Plain, unadorned text. For use when breaking out of a previously-set
  CSS style. Mainly used in elements.

.MainTable 

  Style applied to the cell/table into which all DiscoBoard system 
  output is put. Think of this style as the background style of the 
  system, but hovering over the page background.

.MainMenuRow

  The standard style for a main menu row - the rows which show options, 
  items and navigational heirarchy at the top and bottom of the pages. 
  This is usually a dark colour.

.MainMenuRowAlt

  Allows use of alternating backgrounds for main menu item rows in 
  future releases. Should have a slightly different background colour 
  to its sibling, MainMenuRow.

.MainMenuLink

  Style for presenting a link in the MainMenuRows. This should be a
  colour which stands out over the color of a MainMenuRow *and* a 
  MainMenuRowAlt

.MainMenuLinkLight

  A lighter version of MainMenuLink, this is applied to the username of
  the currently-logged-in user when their name is displayed in the top
  of the page in a MainMenuRow.

.BoardColumn

  This style is used to denote column headings in lists of items in the
  DiscoBoard system. It's usually almost as dark as MainMenuRow, and has
  a light coloured text

.BoardColumnLink

  Can be used for links in BoardColumn cells. Not currently used.

.BoardRowHeading

  The style applied to the heading (subject, post date, edit data and use
  controls) in a Thread display.

.BoardRowHeadingLink

  Style applied to links within BoardRowHeading

.BoardRowBody

  The "normal" style for lists of items in a DiscoBoard system.

.BoardRowBodySticky

  This style is applied to Sticky Threads in a Thread list. You can set 
  it to a slightly different colour to indicate to the user that it's 
  Sticky, while not differentiating it too much from BoardRowBody.

.BoardRowBodyLink

  A normal link in the BoardRowBody style.

.SubjectLink

  The style used to display Thread Subjects.

a.SubjectLink

  The style used to display Thread Subjects, specifically applied to 
  anchor tags. Most SubjectLink styles are bold.

a.SubjectLink:active

  The style used to display a Thread subject that's being clicked on. 
  You could turn it red or a similar effect. Again, bold.

a.SubjectLink:visited

  To indicate to the user that they've seen all a Thread has to offer,
  this should be exactly the same as SubjectLink, but not bold.

.AuthorLink

  The default style applied to a link made on a user's Username.

.AuthorLinkSmall

  A smaller version of the default style applied to a link made on a 
  user's Username, which is used when displaying the identity of the 
  last poster to a thread. This should be exactly the same as 
  AuthorLink, but smaller.

.VersionText

  The style applied to the Version Information in the footer of the 
  normal DiscoBoard system. This should only lightly contrast with 
  MainTable.

.InputSection

  Section headings for user-input forms. Usually just like PlainText, 
  but Bold.

.InputNotes

  Not currently used.

.SignatureTitle

  The style used to display "----- Signature -----" in every message.

.SignatureText

  The style used to display a user's actual signature (could perhaps 
  set this colour to 75% of the normal text colour)

B

  Just a bold text tag.

.red

  Just a red colour tag.

.grey

  Just a grey colour tag.

.statistictext

  The text style used on the statistic line on the main page.

.statisticvalue

  The text style used on the actual statistics within .statistictext.

.QuotedText

  Style which is applied to a table cell when [q][/q] markup text is 
  used.

.tos

  Style applied to the textarea containing the Terms of Service on the
  user registration page.

.AdminMenuLink

  Style applied to menu items in the Administration frame.
