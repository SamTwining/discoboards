Welcome to DiscoBoard, a web-based message board system. It requires PHP 
and MySQL in order to run. A fast web server wouldn't hurt either, if 
you're planning to run a popular message board.

DiscoBoard's basic look and feel is unashamedly modelled after IGN's 
own IGNBoards system which runs at http://boards.ign.com/ - imitation 
is the sincerest form of flattery, after all. 

If you install and use DiscoBoard on your website, I encourge you to 
consider its inspiration and give some thought to signing up for IGN's 
Insider service. More information is at http://insider.ign.com/.

You are encouraged to read this file at the very least, as it contains
important information:

Legalese - Use of DiscoBoard
----------------------------
DiscoBoard is free for non-profit and academic use. Your installation 
and use of DiscoBoard implies an acknowledgement and agreement to this 
stipulation. If you intend to use DiscoBoard in an environment designed
to generate profit, you must first contact the Author (Jason Murray) and
obtain written authorisation for its use or a license for its use. Only
the Author may grant you such permission or issue a license.

This software is provided "as-is", with no warranty. It is the sole 
responsibility of the website owner or administrator to decide whether 
or not to install this software. The Author accepts no responsibility 
for any untoward effects or loss of data that may be incurred by a 
person or organisation running this software. 

Now that that's out of the way - if you use DiscoBoard, I'd like to know
about it. Please drop me a line, because it's my baby and I want to see
how far it manages to spread. If you feel that DiscoBoard is good enough
to warrant some kind of donation (be in monetary or otherwise), I'm not
likely to say no. :)

By the same token, if you have any suggestions or there's a feature you 
really want implemented - please drop by my own message board (you'll 
find the address listed under Support) and let me know rather than just
making the modification yourself - that way, everyone gets a better
DiscoBoard system.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Note About Configurations And Updates
---------------------------------------
There are only 3 files users should have to modify in any DiscoBoard 
distribution:

 - settings.x.php
 - theme.blah.php, and
 - stylesheet.blah.php
 
These files are the only three files you can be guaranteed will not be
written over when an update to DiscoBoard is released - they are the
files that are generated by you, and should be different from one 
version of DiscoBoard to the next. If you download a DiscoBoard update,
you should be able to simply extract it into the directory to which
you've installed DiscoBoard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features
--------
DiscoBoard closely mimics as many features of IGNBoards as possible:

 - Easy to set up - edit the Settings file to make the boards your own, 
   pump the database information into MySQL and you're done

 - Editable HTML template, so you can change the look and feel of the 
   website and stylesheet easily

 - Editable email templates so you can customise notification emails etc 
   with your branding

 - Users can edit messages after they're posted for an admin-defineable 
   amount of time

 - Secure database schema (doesn't store a password for a user, instead 
   hashes the password so a compromise of the database does not require 
   a password change en-masse)

 - Secure password reset (recovery) process (uses email verification)

 - Users can log in and log out on any page, although some pages require
   a user to be logged in for accessing

 - Comparable user profile fields to IGN boards (although, it doesn't 
   have Peoplelink ID because I've never heard of it) also shows online
   status indicators for all Instant Messaging mediums. By editing the
   templates of the profile display pages, you can supress certain 
   fields from standard users and leave them available for Admins

 - Comparable display settings to IGN boards (threads-, posts-per-page)
   with the added option of Timezone configuration allowing a user to
   see all times in their local time

 - Favourites: boards, threads, and a watched user list

 - Similar icon selection system, allows users to specify their own icon 
   URL if the Admin allows it

 - Markup codes can be used in the message body, subject line, Board
   name and Group name

 - Username formatting, slightly more complicated than IGN's

 - Supports Private messages between users, and they can be deleted

 - Sticky threads (set by moderators)

 - Users can post Polls within Boards just like IGN Boards

 - Logs IPs of users as they sign up and post, allows you to compare IP 
   addresses and attempt to track down users with multiple accounts
   (note that, in the grand scheme of things, using IP addresses to 
   track users is a bad idea)

 - Access Classes have a default name format which is applied to a
   user when you move them into the class

 - Admins can set a Threshold so that users can't post more than a given
   number of messages in an arbitrary time period - allows you to limit
   the number of polls while still letting users post

 - Admins can decide whether or not to show who made the last post to a
   thread

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation

The following documentation is available for the system:

 - README
   This is what you're looking at. It's an index to the documentation
   and a feature list.
